I don’t claim to know what will happen with AI/Prophecy. I can’t tell you what we should do (although I have some basic ideas, which I’ll discuss in the conclusion of this series).

Mostly, I’m just pointing a spotlight at this major issue that no-one is discussing.

This should be my last piece before my conclusions. Here, I want to discuss what you might call the Game Theory of all this.

We are about to see a huge range of social movements, large and small, broadly distributed or specific to geographies or groups. Most will be benign; some won’t.

As the world fills to the brim with these things; as they compete for your attention, for money, for power; as they cooperate and compete with each other, what can we say?
