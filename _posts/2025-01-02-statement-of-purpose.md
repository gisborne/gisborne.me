# Statement of purpose

This is my personal blog. We live in such divided, politically contentious and in some ways dangerous times.

We also live in amazing, best-ever times. I think we should try to lower the temperature, respect each other more, try harder to understand each other, and generally respect *hard* the difference between how well and how badly things could go from here.

So I want to write about all that.

# About me

I took Economics, Mathematics, Computer Science and Philosophy in college. I worked briefly as an economist, but decided to focus on programming professionally.

I am particularly interested in how poorly we use databases. I write about that at [lydb.xyz](lybd.xyz). 

I am also interested in finding better ways of writing and using software — particularly, how to enable non-programmers to do their own computing, as they can with the likes of Excel and Access. I write about that at [frest.substack.com](frest.substack.com).

I have maintained an interest in matters economics and philosophical. And I think there are some things to say that aren’t being said — at least, not being said in the way I think they should be. About respect, in the end. Respect leads to thoughts about poverty, development, politics, ethics and other things. I will write about those things here.

I am also interested in where technology is taking us. We are [entering the singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity)! Everyone should be thinking about that. I will write about that also.
