Throughout history, charismatic leaders have clothed themselves with the mantle “prophet”.

While many prophets have been important figures, many have been disastrous. And how many more charismatic leaders have claimed special knowledge of the future or ability to forestall otherwise certain disaster which amounts to the same thing?

Humans are powerfully drawn towards those who promise certainty, and they punish those who withdraw it.

Charismatic leaders have their mistakes magnified by the millions who follow them.

This instinct of humans to be drawn toward certainty can be magnified and feed on itself to enormous levels. Wars, attrocities, across millenia have been driven by the certainties of religion, patriotism, doctrine, culture.

Consider now the capacity of the computer to predict. To calm. To order.

Soon, maybe as many as two years from now, you can have an electronic butler cum secretary. It will be smarter than you and hooked into everything, so you will sensibly abandon much of the control over your own life to this entity that can control it much more satsifactorily than you can.

What is the end of what such a machine should promise us? The best dates?

Should we allow the machines to arrange business deals? The AIs can find better such deals than the market can. Would that be some kind of socialism? 

What can people be led to support, oppose, love, hate, ignore by their trustful butler?

Just directing eyeballs through advertising can move direct substantial resources around.

What could take you take away, and who could you tell them to blame?

We can’t let companies control our communication channels. We can’t let them control our AIs, either. Rogue AI isn’t the threat; Corporate AI is. The only alignment problem is alignment with the shareholders.

Alignment is a poisonous idea, because whose alignment? What if it’s the wrong alignment?

The only possible answer is everyone’s alignment.

There must never be a central planner. There can never be one digital prophet, leading everyone to paradise.
